# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, To-Do List, and Password Generator Calculator

This repository contains three projects implemented in Python: a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, a command-line To-Do List application, and a command-line Password Generator.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

### Features

- **User Input:** Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
- **Computer Selection:** Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
- **Game Logic:** Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
- **Display Result:** Show the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game (win, lose, or draw).
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.
- **Play Again:** Allow the user to play another round after each game.
- **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` script using Python.
4. Follow the instructions in the GUI to play the game.
5. After each round, you can choose to play again or exit the game.

## To-Do List Application

### Features

- **User Interface:** Create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python.
- **Task Management:** Allow users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.
- **Storage:** Implement storage for tasks, such as text files or databases.
- **Optional Features:** Include additional functionalities like priority levels, due dates, categories, and reminders.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the To-Do List application script (`todo_list.py` or `todo_list_gui.py`) using Python.
4. Follow the instructions in the command-line or GUI interface to manage your tasks.

## Password Generator

### Features

- **User Input:** Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
- **Generate Password:** Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
- **Display the Password:** Print the generated password on the screen.
- **Optional Complexity:** Allow users to specify the complexity of the password, such as including uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Password Generator script (`password_generator.py`) using Python.
4. Follow the instructions to generate a strong and random password.

### calculator

### Features
1. Allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).
3. Includes "=" button to calculate the result and a "Clear" button to clear the input.
4. Displays the result of the calculation in a readable format.
### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script (calculator_gui.py) in your terminal or command prompt.
